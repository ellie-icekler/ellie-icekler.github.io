    <h2>Who am I?</h2>

    <p>My name is Elisa Claire Alemán Carreón, I'm an international PhD student born in Mexico, currently and am currently pursuing a PhD in Information Science and Control Engineering in the Nagaoka University of Technology, Nagaoka, Japan. I've been in Japan for 4 years, and I am currently doing my research in the Knowledge Mining Laboratory in NUT, under the guidance of Dr. Hirofumi Nonaka. I do research in Artificial Neural Networks, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Mining. My research interests are currently Text and Data mining for management purposes and multilingual endeavors.</p>

    <p>Because my name is Mexican, two names and two family names, many automatic crawlers show me as ECA Carreón in the papers I've authored, but this is incorrect. If you want to cite my work, Elisa is my first name, Claire my second name, and Alemán Carreón is my surname. </p>

    <h2>What do I do?</h2>

    <p>Right now, my main interest is research in the Information Science area. I've been striving to make several publications to international journals and conferences. In my free time, I am also an artist, I mainly use ink on paper. I also do many martial arts, and I am the president of the Aikido club in my university, while I also do Karate in my free time. In the past, I've also participated in musical ensembles with my ocarina and quena.</p>
