    <h2>Who am I?</h2>

    <p>My name is Elisa Claire Alemán Carreón, I'm an international PhD student born in Mexico. Currently I am currently pursuing a PhD in Information Science in Nagaoka, Japan, and I've been in Japan for over 4 years. In my spare time, however, I dedicate myself to many forms of art. Visual art, music, martial arts, poetry, and so on. Currently I prefer to use ink as my main medium, and I've begun to do a little bit more of hand-crafts. I like to try and participate in each year's Inktober to keep myself practicing my technique.</p>

    <h2>What do I do?</h2>

    <p>Right now, my main interest is research in the Information Science area, but in the past I have studied a bachelors degree in Animation and Digital Effects. In my free time, I am also an artist, I mainly use ink on paper, but I have used digital mediums in the past, such as digital painting, vector illustration designing, 3D modeling, 3D animation, 2D animation, etc. I also enjoy handcrafting, wood carving and other manual arts. </p>

    <p>Aside from the visual arts, I also do many martial arts, and I am the president of the Aikido club in my university, while I also do Karate and Yoga in my free time. However I've also practiced Kendo, Shorinji-Kenpo, Judo and I would like to join archery in the future.</p>

    <p>I also have a wide range of musical tastes and hobbies. I like composing music in digital software. I have a few old compositions for a rock album that I never finished, and I did videogame music for a game that never quite released. However, most of the time I enjoy playing music, I have around 5 ocarinas, 3 quenas, 2 zampoñas, an Irish tin-whistle, and a few miscellaneous traditional flutes. I also quite enjoy just whistling and blowing on bottles. I've participated in musical ensembles with my ocarina and quena before, but few were recorded in good quality.</p>
